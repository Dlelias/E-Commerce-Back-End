This video demonstrates how to seed files. In this example I created the database in SequelPro however the command can be ran directly from the terminal with mysql. Once the databases has been created you can seed your database with NPM run seed.

Once the database has been created and seeded you can test your CRUD route. In this example we are using Insomnia to test.  This is a part 1 out of 2 video. This begins with /categories. The video demonstrates how one can create data, read data, update data, and delete data.
